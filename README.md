## Background 

I am born and raised in Queens, I currently reside in Jackson Heights where I commute to school. I went to a high school in the Lower East Side and there I first learned about computer science. It was right before 9th grade started and there was a program and I learned HTML and CSS. This wasn't always my interest though, I started college as a Natural Science major on the pre-health track. I have tried out many things by volunteering for this reason.
